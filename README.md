## Introduction

I've always been a huge fan of The Legend of Zelda series, and I wanted to create a Zelda-like game to improve my programming skills and explore the capabilities of AI language models like GPT-4 and GitHub Copilot in my development process. This game is a result of that journey, and I'm excited to share it with the world.
